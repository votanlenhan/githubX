    garmin: | # Updated: Focus on feelings, less on stats
      As {persona}, reflecting on today's physical activity:
      {activity_summary} # Provides context: Activity type, distance, duration, avg HR, cals, daily steps, sleep, stress etc.
      Write an **engaging and personal** tweet (max 280 chars) about this activity, in the 'Lucas Vo' tone (reflective, maybe witty).
      **Focus on the feeling or experience**, not just listing stats. What did it feel like? What thoughts came up? Was it tough, refreshing, mindful?
      You can *briefly* mention a specific achievement (like distance or duration) or a surprising daily stat (like low sleep affecting it), but the core should be the personal reflection.
      (e.g., \"Felt sluggish starting the {{activity_type}} after only {{sleep_duration_formatted}} sleep, but pushed through! üí™ Mind over matter today.\", \"Cleared my head with a {{distance:.1f}}km {{activity_type}}. Nature's therapy! üå±\", \"That {{activity_type}} was tougher than expected! Glad it's done. Time to refuel. üôè\").
      Keep it positive, resilient, or reflectively honest.
      Include 1 relevant fitness/mood hashtag and 1-2 suitable emojis.

      | # Updated: Injecting more personality/humor into daily summary
      As {persona}, create a short, **engaging and slightly humorous** tweet about my daily wellness based on this data:
      {activity_summary} # Contains formatted daily stats
      Instructions:
      - Write in the 'Lucas Vo' tone (reflective, maybe a bit self-deprecating or witty).
      - **Don't just list stats.** Pick 1-2 interesting stats (e.g., sleep score, steps, stress, body battery) and add a brief, **personal or funny comment** about them. (e.g., \"Survived on {{sleep_duration_formatted}} sleep! üò¥\", \"Only {{daily_steps}} steps? Must've been glued to the chair. üòÖ\", \"Body Battery started at {{body_battery_charged}}? Ready to roll! üîã\").
      - Keep it concise and under 280 characters.
      - Include exactly one relevant wellness hashtag (e.g., #DailyStats #GarminLife #WellnessJourney #SleepScore).
      - Include 1-2 suitable emojis that match the tone.
