    garmin: | # Updated prompt to use richer activity_summary
      As {persona}, reflecting on today's efforts:
      {activity_summary} # This now includes activity AND daily stats like steps, sleep, stress
      Write an **upbeat but reflective** tweet (max 280 chars) about this fitness activity and the day's context, in the 'Lucas Vo' tone.
      Briefly highlight the main activity ({activity_type} for {distance:.1f}km / {duration_formatted}).
      Optionally, connect it to a daily stat if interesting (e.g., "despite only {sleep_duration_formatted} sleep", "hit {daily_steps} steps", "stress was {stress_qualifier}").
      Focus on accomplishment, resilience, or just documenting the day.
      Keep it positive and concise.
      Include 1 relevant fitness hashtag and maybe 1-2 suitable emoji (e.g., üí™, üôè, üå±, üö∂, üò¥, üíØ).

      - Include 1-2 suitable emojis (e.g., üå±, üëç, üíØ, üö∂, üò¥, üîã).
