(e.g., "Survived on {sleep_duration_formatted} sleep! 😴", "Only {daily_steps} steps? Must've been glued to the chair. 😅", "Body Battery started at {body_battery_charged}? Ready to roll! 🔋").
      - Keep it concise and under 280 characters.
      - Include exactly one relevant wellness hashtag (e.g., #DailyStats #GarminLife #WellnessJourney #SleepScore).
      - Include 1-2 suitable emojis that match the tone.
